1.  Introduction

   Computational services often implement access control within their
   components by separating Policy Decision Points (PDPs) from Policy
   Enforcement Points (PEPs).  PDPs and PEPs are defined in [XACML].
   Communication between PDPs and PEPs follows similar patterns across
   different software and services that require or provide authorization
   information.  The Authorization API described in this document



Tulshibagwale                Standards Track                    [Page 1]

                                  azapi                        June 2023


   enables different providers to offer PDP and PEP capabilities without
   having to bind themselves to one particular implementation of a PDP
   or PEP.

1.1.  Model

   The Authorization API is a REST API published by the PDP, to which
   the PEP acts as a client.  The Authorization API is itself authorized
   using OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749]

1.2.  Features

   The Authorization API has two main features:

   *  An Access Evaluations API, which enables a PEP to find out if a
      specific request can be permitted to access specific resources

   *  A Search API, which enables a PEP to discover all assets that a
      principal has access to, by specifying conditions for the access

2.  Terminology

   Principal:  The user or robotic principal about whom the
      Authorization API call is being made

   Asset:  The target of the request; the resource that the principal
      about which the Authorization API is being made

   Action:  The method by which the Principal relates to the Asset in an
      Authorization API call.

3.  API Specification

   The Authorization API has two parts, Access Evaluation and Search.
   Each of these is defined below:

3.1.  API Version

   This document describes the API version 1.  Any updates to this API
   through subsequent revisions of this document or through other
   documents MAY augment this API, but MUST NOT modify the API described
   here.  Augmentation MAY include additional API methods or additional
   parameters to existing API methods, additional authorization
   mechanisms or additional optional headers in API requests.  All API
   methods for version 1 MUST be immediately preceded by the relative
   URL path /v1/.

3.2.  API Authorization

   This API SHALL be authenticated using the OAuth 2.0 Bearer access
   token [RFC6750] to authorize API calls

3.3.  Request Identification

   All requests to the API MUST have request identifiers to uniquely
   identify them.  The API client (PEP) is responsible for generating
   the request identifier.  The request identifier SHALL be provided
   using the HTTP Header X-Request-Id.  The value of this header is an
   arbitrary string.  The following non-normative example describes this
   header:

   POST /access/v1/evaluations HTTP 1.1
   Authorization: Bearer mF_9.B5f-4.1JqM
   X-Request-Id: bfe9eb29-ab87-4ca3-be83-a1d5d8305716

                        Figure 1: Request Id Example

3.4.  Principals

   A Principal is the user or robotic principal about whom the
   Authorization API is being invoked.  The Principal may be requesting
   access at the time the Authorization API is invoked, or the Principal
   may be of interest in a Search API call.

   A Principal is a JSON [RFC8259] object that has the following fields:

   id:  REQUIRED, A field, whose value is of type string, which uniquely
      identifies the user.  This identifier could be an email address,
      or it might be an internal identifier such as a UUID or employee
      ID.

   ipAddress:  OPTIONAL, A field, whose value is of type string, which
      is a [RFC4001] text representation of the IP Address

   deviceId:  OPTIONAL, A field, whose value is of type string, which
      uniquely identifies the device of the Principal

   The following non-normative example describes a Principal:

   {
       "id": "atul@sgnl.ai",
       "ipAddress": "172.217.22.14",
       "deviceId": "8:65:ee:17:7e:0b"
   }

3.5.  Assets

   An Asset is the target of an access request.  It is a JSON [RFC8259]
   object that has the following fields:

   id:  REQUIRED, the asset Id of the asset.  It's value is a string
      specifying the identifier of the asset

   type:  OPTIONAL, the type of the asset.  It's value is a string that
      specifies the type of the asset

   attributeNames:  OPTIONAL, an array of strings, each string
      representing the name of an attribute of the asset.

   The following is a non-normative example of an Asset:

   {
       "id": "somevalue",
       "type": "user",
       "attributeNames": [
           "homeAddress",
           "birthDate",
           "employeeId"
       ]
   }

                          Figure 3: Example Asset

3.6.  Actions

   An action is the type of access that the requester intends to
   perform.  There are common actions defined herein, or the action may
   be custom, which could be specific to the application being accessed
   or shared across a applications but not listed in the common actions
   below

3.6.1.  Common Actions

   The following common actions are defined herein:

   "access":  A generic action that could mean any type of access.  This
      is useful if the policy or application is not interested in
      different decisions for different types of actions

   "create":  The action to create a new entity, which MAY be defined by
      the asset field in the request



Tulshibagwale                Standards Track                    [Page 4]

   "read":  The action to read the content.  Based on the asset being
      accessed, this could mean a list functionality or reading an
      individual asset contents

   "update":  The action to update the content of an existing entity.
      This MAY represent a partial update or an entire replacement of
      the entity.  The entity MAY be identified by the asset in the
      request

   "delete":  The action to delete an entity.  The entity MAY be
      identified by the asset in the request

   Policies MAY incorporate common action names to provide different
   decisions based on the action

3.6.2.  Custom Actions

   Any action that is not one of the above is a custom action.  Policies
   MAY incorporate custom action names if decisions need to be taken
   differently for different custom actions

3.7.  Access Query

   An Access Query is a question about whether a principal can access a
   specific asset.  It is a JSON object with the following fields:

   action:  REQUIRED.  The type of access that is to be performed.  Its
      value is a string that describes the action.  This value of this
      field is as described in the Section 3.6 section.

   asset:  REQUIRED.  The asset about which this query is.  It's format
      is as described in the Section 3.5 section

   The following is a non-normative example of an Access Query:

   {
       "action": "stream",
       "asset": {
           "id": "1234",
           "type": "webcam",
           "attributeNames": [
               "lowRes",
               "motionOnly"]
       }
   }

   {#example-access-query title="Example Access Query"}

3.8.  Access Decision

   An access decision is a JSON string which can have one of the
   following values:

   "allow":  The access request is permitted to go forward

   "deny":  The access request is denied and MUST NOT be permitted to go
      forward

3.9.  Access Query Decision

   An Access Query Decision is a tuple of an asset, action and a
   decision, represented as a JSON object.  It has the following fields:

   action:  The action for which the decision is provided.  The format
      is as described in the Section 3.6 section

   asset:  The asset for which the decision is provided.  The format is
      as described in the Section 3.5 section.  This asset MAY be
      greater in scope than described in the Access Query (Section 3.7),
      i.e. It MAY describe an asset more generally than specified in the
      Access Query.  However, it MUST NOT be more specific than the
      asset described in the Access Query.

   decision:  The decision for the above asset and action.  The format
      is as described in the Section 3.8 section

   The following is a non-normative example of an Access Query Decision:

   {
       "action": "stream",
       "asset": {
           "id": "1234"
       },
       "decision": "deny"
   }

   {#example-access-query-decision title="Example Access Query
   Decision"}

3.10.  Access Evaluations API

   The access evaluations is a means for a PEP to request decisions for
   a number of assets for a single request context.

   The Access Evaluations API is available at the relative URL
   evaluations via the POST HTTP method.

3.10.1.  Access Evaluation Request

   The content of the request body is a JSON Object with the following
   fields:

   principal:  A principal as described in the Section 3.4 section

   queries:  An array of queries defined in section Section 3.7 about
      access to specific assets

   POST /evaluations HTTP/1.1
   Host: pdp.mycompany.com
   Authorization: <myoauthtoken>

   {
     "principal": {
       "id": "atul@sgnl.ai",
     },
     "queries": [
       {
         "action": "read",
         "asset": {
           "type": "customer"
         }
       },
       {

           "type": "customer",
           "attributeNames": [
             "homeAddress"
           ]
         }
       }
     ]
   }

3.10.2.  Access Evaluation Response

   The success response to an Access Evaluation Request is an Access
   Evaluation Response.  It is a HTTP response of type application/json.
   It's body is a JSON object that contains the following fields:

   iat:  REQUIRED.  The issued at time in integer format, expressed as
      epoch milliseconds

   exp:  REQUIRED.  The time in integer format, expressed at epoch

      milliseconds, after which the response SHOULD NOT be used

   principal:  REQUIRED.  The principal for which the response is being
      issued.  The format of this field is as described in the
      Section 3.4 section

   decisions:  REQUIRED.  An array of Access Query Decisions as
      described in the Section 3.9 section

   evaluationDuration:  REQUIRED.  The time in milliseconds, in integer
