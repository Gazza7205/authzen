I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this effort come to fruition.

Here are some important resources:

  * Mailing list: Join our [mailing list](https://lists.openid.net/mailman/listinfo/openid-specs-authzen) to ask questions or provide feedback
  * Bugs? the issue tracker above is where to report them
